## 📚 The Terms

*Alphabetical order. Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) to search.*

---

### A

**API** *(ay-pee-eye)*
> **The Bridge Between Apps.** When two different apps need to talk to each other, they use an API. Think of it like a translator at the United Nations — App A speaks French, App B speaks Japanese, and the API lets them have a conversation.
>
> *Example:* "When you book a flight on Expedia, it uses an API to talk to Southwest's system."

---

### B

**Backend**
> **The Kitchen.** The part of an app you never see — where all the cooking happens. The frontend is the restaurant dining room (what you see), the backend is the kitchen (where the magic happens).
>
> *Example:* "The backend stores all our customer data."

**Bug**
> **An Error or Mistake in the Code.** When something doesn't work the way it should. Not an actual insect — just a problem that needs fixing.
>
> *Example:* "There's a bug that makes the button disappear on mobile."

---

### C

**Commit** *(rhymes with "vomit")*
> **A Save Point.** Like saving your game in a video game. Developers "commit" their work so they can go back to that exact moment if something goes wrong later.
>
> *Example:* "I'll commit this change before I try anything risky."

**Cloud** *(the)*
> **Someone Else's Computer.** When people say "it's in the cloud," they mean the files/app live on computers owned by Amazon, Google, or Microsoft — not on your personal computer.
>
> *Example:* "Our documents are stored in the cloud, so you can access them from anywhere."

---

### D

**Dashboard**
> **The Control Panel.** A single screen that shows you the most important information at a glance. Like the dashboard in your car shows speed, fuel, etc.
>
> *Example:* "The sales dashboard shows this month's revenue."

**Deploy** *(dee-ploy)*
> **Go Live.** When we take code from the developer's computer and put it on the real website/app where everyone can use it.
>
> *Example:* "We'll deploy the new feature on Monday."

---

### F

**Frontend**
> **The Dining Room.** The part of an app you actually see and interact with — buttons, colors, text, images. Everything on your screen.
>
> *Example:* "The frontend needs to look good on mobile phones."

---

### G

**Git** *(rhymes with "hit")*
> **The Time Machine for Code.** A system that tracks every change ever made to the code, so developers can go back in time if they mess something up.
>
> *Example:* "It's saved in Git, so we can recover the old version."

---

### I

**Integration**
> **Making Two Things Work Together.** When we connect one app or system to another so they can share information automatically.
>
> *Example:* "We need an integration between our calendar and the booking system."

---

### J

**JSON** *(jay-sahn)*
> **A Structured Note.** A standardized way computers write notes to each other. Like a form with labeled fields instead of free-form text.
>
> *Example:* "The API sends the data in JSON format."

---

### M

**Markdown**
> **Simple Formatting Language.** What this document is written in! A way to add formatting (bold, headers, lists) using simple symbols instead of clicking buttons.
>
> *Example:* "Put `**` around words to make them **bold**."

---

### P

**PR** *(or "Pull Request")*
> **A Request to Add Code.** When a developer wants to add their code to the main project, they submit a PR. It's like raising your hand and saying "Can I add this?" so others can review it first.
>
> *Example:* "Jimmy opened a PR for the new login feature."

**Production** *(or "Prod")*
> **The Real Thing.** The live version that actual customers use. As opposed to "development" or "staging" which are practice versions.
>
> *Example:* "Don't test on production — use the staging environment."

---

### R

**Repo** *(short for Repository)*
> **The Project Folder.** Where all the code for a project lives. Think of it as the master folder that contains everything.
>
> *Example:* "Clone the repo to get a copy of all the code."

---

### S

**Server**
> **A Computer That Serves.** A computer that's always on, always connected to the internet, waiting to respond to requests. When you visit a website, you're asking a server to send you the page.
>
> *Example:* "Our server went down, so the website was unreachable."

**Staging**
> **The Dress Rehearsal.** A practice version of the app that looks real but isn't the actual live version. Where we test things before going live.
>
> *Example:* "Let's test the new feature on staging first."

---

### U

**UI** *(you-eye)*
> **What You See.** User Interface. All the visual elements — buttons, menus, colors, text. The design of the screens.
>
> *Example:* "The UI needs to be more intuitive."

**UX** *(you-ex)*
> **How It Feels.** User Experience. Not just what it looks like, but how it feels to use. Is it confusing? Delightful? Frustrating?
>
> *Example:* "The UX is clunky — users keep getting lost."

---

### W

**Webhook**
> **An Automatic Notification.** When something happens in one app, it automatically pings another app. Like a "ding!" notification between systems.
>
> *Example:* "When someone fills out the form, a webhook tells our system to send them an email."
