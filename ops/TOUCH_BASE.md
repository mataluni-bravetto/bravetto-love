## ✨ The Golden Rules

| **Quality over quantity** | One meaningful connection beats 10 superficial ones |
| **Give before you ask** | Lead with value, not requests |
| **Be genuine** | People feel when it's transactional |
| **Follow through** | If you promise to connect, do it |
| **Remember details** | Note birthdays, kids' names, their challenges |
