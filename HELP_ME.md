## 🔧 Common "Uh Oh" Moments

### "I accidentally deleted something!"

**Don't panic.** Here's how to undo:
1. Press `Cmd+Z` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Z` (Windows) to undo
2. Keep pressing it to undo more steps
3. If you already closed the file: Ask me in chat — I can help recover it

### "I don't know where I am!"

**Go home:**
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` → type "Run Task" → choose **"🏠 GO HOME"**
2. Or click: [🏠 Home Screen](./README.md)

### "The Magic Buttons aren't working!"

**Try this:**
1. Make sure you're in the `bravetto-love` folder
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (not just Cmd+P)
3. Type "Run Task" (not just "Task")
4. If it still doesn't work: Ask me in chat

### "I see weird code/text I don't understand!"

**That's okay!** You might have opened a settings file by accident.
1. Close the file (click the X on the tab)
2. Go back to [Home](./README.md)
3. Only open files that have friendly names like `VISION_BOARD.md` or `EVENTS.md`

### "I want to undo ALL my changes today!"

**Ask me in chat:** "Can you help me undo my changes from today?"
I'll walk you through it safely.

## 🗣️ How to Ask for Help

**In the chat, just type naturally:**

✅ Good questions:
- "I'm confused about the budget template"
- "How do I add a new person to my contacts?"
- "Something weird happened when I clicked X"
- "This looks wrong, can you check it?"

❌ You don't need to:
- Use technical terms
- Feel embarrassed
- Apologize for asking

**I'm here to help. That's literally my job.** 💚
