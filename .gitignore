# 🌿 AbëLOVE Workspace — What NOT to save to the cloud

# System files (your computer's clutter, not your work)
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*.swp
*~

# Editor settings that are just for you
.vscode/settings.json

# Sensitive files (anything with passwords or secrets)
*.secret
*.env
credentials.txt

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
*.log

# Large files that shouldn't be stored in Git
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.mov
*.mp4

# That's it! Everything else will be saved and synced. 💚
